# Streaming with Apache Flink

This a forked repository that contains examples and tutorials for streaming data processing using Apache Flink.

## Introduction

[Apache Flink](https://flink.apache.org/) is an open-source stream processing framework for distributed, high-performing, always-available, and accurate data streaming applications. This repository provides practical examples to help you understand and explore the capabilities of Apache Flink.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:
- Apache Flink
- Apache Kafka (for Kafka examples)
- MySQL (for sink examples)
- Python 3.x (for PyFlink examples)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hung2xt/streaming-with-apache-flink.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired example directory:
   ```bash
   cd streaming-with-apache-flink/<example-directory>
   ```
3. Follow the specific instructions provided in each example's folder.

## Repository Structure
